1. LP - Lost on you

When you get older, plainer, saner
When you rembember all the danger we came from
Burning like embers, falling, tender
Long before the days of no surrender
year ago and well you know

Smoke 'em if you got 'em
'Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll neveer get to heaven
'Cause I don't know how

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the thins I've lost on you

Tell me are they lost on you?

Just that you could cut me loose
after everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Wishing I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind
Hold me like you neverlost your patience
Tell me hat you love me more than hate me all the time
And you're still mine

So smoke 'em if you've got 'em
'Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven
This can turn around.

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the thins I've lost on you

Tell me are hey lost on you?

Just that you could cut me loose

Afer everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Is that lost on you?
Baby, is that lost on you?
is that lost on you?

Is that lost on you?
